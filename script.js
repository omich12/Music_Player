    lyrics: `I’m sorry but
            Don’t wanna talk
            I need a moment before i go
            Its nothing personal
            I draw the blinds
            They don’t need to see me cry
            Cause even if they understand
            They don’t understand
            So then when I’m finished
            I’m all ‘bout my business
            And ready to save the world
            I’m takin my misery
            Make it my bitch
            Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl
            So, take aim and fire away
            I’ve never been so wide awake
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way
            The blood moon is on the rise
            The fire burning in my eyes
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way
            I’m very sorry, but I’m leaving
            Cause I found out that I’m nothing by your side
            And I got tired of fighting and being at war in vain
            And tired of standing in the fire line and burning my hands
            I accept my flaws, cause I’m a human too
            You can’t see that I do this because I love you
            But now, I don’t have anything more to do here
            I’ll go, it’s my time to take off
            I’ll go my own way, far away from you
            So, take aim and fire away
            I’ve never been so wide awake
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way
            The blood moon is on the rise
            The fire burning in my eyes
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way
            So, take aim and fire away
            I’ve never been so wide awake
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way
            The blood moon is on the rise
            The fire burning in my eyes
            No, nobody but me can keep me safe
            And I’m on my way`,

            Do you see the rays comin' from my eye
            Walkin' through the place that digi-man is breakin' it down?
            Me and my white short shorts
            And I can't see color, any color will do
            I'll stick on you, that's why they call me "pit bull"
            'Cause I'm the man of the land
            When they see me they say, who?

                    And she's gonna scream out, "This is great" (oh my god, this is great)
                    Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree

            lyrics: `The club isn't the best place to find a lover
                    So the bar is where I go
                    Me and my friends at the table doing shots
                    Drinking fast and then we talk slow
                    Come over and start up a conversation with just me
                    And trust me I'll give it a chance now
                    Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
                    And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
                    Girl, you know I want your love
                    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                    Come on now, follow my lead
                    I may be crazy, don't mind me
                    Say, boy, let's not talk too much
                    Grab on my waist and put that body on me
                    Come on now, follow my lead
                    Come, come on now, follow my lead
                    I'm in love with the shape of you
                    We push and pull like a magnet do
                    Although my heart is falling too
                    I'm in love with your body
                    And last night you were in my room
                    And now my bedsheets smell like you
                    Every day discovering something brand new
                    I'm in love with your body
                    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
                    I'm in love with your body
                    (Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)

                    Every day discovering something brand new
                    I'm in love with the shape of you
                    One week in we let the story begin
                    We're going out on our first date
                    You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
                    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
                    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
                    And how your family is doing okay
                    And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
                    Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
                    Girl, you know I want your love
                    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
                    Come on now, follow my lead

                    Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow

                    So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night

                    Ooh
                    Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
                    I don't even wanna do this anymore
                    'Cause you already know what you mean to me
                    And our love's the only war worth fighting for
                    Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
